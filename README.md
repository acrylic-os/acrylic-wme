# Acrylic WME

This [Acrylic](https://github.com/acrylic-os) theme makes Acrylic look like [OneShot: World Machine Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/).

Note that while this is under the MIT license, Acrylic itself is under a different Polyform license. And this is just a hobby project with no relation to Future Cat Games.

## Usage

To apply the theme:

1. Go to a version of Acrylic with full support for extensions ([0.2.0-b32](https://github.com/acrylic-os/core/commit/c91829373ba43922273907a13cd851b006cb5a7b) works, but 0.1.6 doesn't)
2. Go into the JS command line in DevTools
3. Type `acr.loadExtension("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/acrylic-os/acrylic-wme@refs/heads/main/src")`
4. The theme will apply itself

[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) is used as requesting directly from Github will cause a CORS issue.
