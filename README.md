# Acrylic WME

This [Acrylic](https://github.com/acrylic-os) theme makes Acrylic look like [OneShot: World Machine Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/).

Note that while this is under the MIT license, Acrylic itself is under a different Polyform license. And this is just a hobby project with no relation to Future Cat Games.

## Installation

In [Acrylic](https://github.com/acrylic-os/core) [0.2.0-b34](https://github.com/acrylic-os/core/commit/1274e829f8bbec21c3bacb555fea7efc310fcaf2) or higher:

1. Open Settings
2. Go to the *Extensions* tab
3. In *Loaded extensions*, uninstall your existing theme, which would probably be `default`
4. In the popup, click *Close*
5. In *Add a new extension*, put `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/acrylic-os/acrylic-wme@refs/heads/main/src` and click *Load*
6. This time, click *Reload* in the popup

[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) is used as requesting directly from Github will cause a CORS issue.
