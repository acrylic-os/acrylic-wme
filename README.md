# Acrylic WME

This [Acrylic](https://github.com/acrylic-os) theme makes Acrylic look like [OneShot: World Machine Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/).

Note that while this is under the MIT license, Acrylic itself is under a different Polyform license. This is just a hobby project and has no relation to Future Cat Games.
